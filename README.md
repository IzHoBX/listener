Your ultimate networking assistance.

We are attend networking sessions, or self-introduction sessions. 

If you are troubled by the fact that you couldn't remember all their names and details, fret not, the listener is here to help you!

Open the app, press start, leave your phone in your pocket and just walk into the networking session! The listener is there to extract the name, age and other personal information of everyone you have talked to and store it for you!
