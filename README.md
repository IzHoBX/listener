# Listener
Your ultimate networking assistance.

We are attend networking sessions, or self-introduction sessions. 

If you are troubled by the fact that you couldn't remember all their names and details, fret not, the listener is here to help you!

Open the app, press start, leave your phone in your pocket and just walk into the networking session! The listener is there to extract the name, age and other personal information of everyone you have talked to and store it for you!

No more embarassing moments of forgetting people's name!

## Background
Listener is developed by the zongchou team for NUS Hackathon 2018. 

## Limitations
Due to time constraint (24hrs), the current version of the listener only extracts name and age using static hotword detection. 
Also, because we relied on Google voice recognition service, its effectiveness in noisy surroundings is yet to be improved.
